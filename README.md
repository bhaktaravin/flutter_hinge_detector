# Flutter Hinge Detector

A comprehensive Flutter application that detects and responds to hinge states on foldable devices. This app provides real-time hinge angle detection, visual feedback, and simulation capabilities for testing on non-foldable devices.

## Features

ðŸ”„ **Real-time Hinge Detection**: Monitors hinge angle changes using device sensors and native APIs
ðŸ“± **Multi-Device Support**: Works with various foldable devices (Surface Duo, Galaxy Fold, Pixel Fold, etc.)
ðŸŽ¨ **Visual Feedback**: Animated hinge visualizer showing current state and angle
ðŸŽ® **Simulation Mode**: Test different hinge positions on regular devices
ðŸ“Š **Comprehensive UI**: Detailed information about device type, angles, and sensor data
ðŸ”§ **Native Integration**: Uses Android's WindowManager API for accurate hinge detection

## Supported Hinge States

- **Closed** (0Â°-10Â°): Device completely closed
- **Half Open** (10Â°-45Â°): Partially open, ideal for notifications
- **Open** (45Â°-90Â°): Dual screen mode
- **Laptop** (90Â°-120Â°): Perfect for typing
- **Book** (120Â°-160Â°): Great for reading
- **Tent** (160Â°-170Â°): Ideal for presentations
- **Flat** (170Â°-180Â°): Tablet mode

## Requirements

- Flutter 3.8.1 or higher
- Android API level 24 or higher (for foldable device features)
- Kotlin support

## Dependencies

- `sensors_plus`: For accelerometer and gyroscope data
- `device_info_plus`: For device identification
- `dual_screen`: For foldable device features

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd flutter_hinge_detector
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. Run the app:
```bash
flutter run
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

The app automatically detects hinge changes and displays:
- Current hinge state with color-coded status
- Precise angle measurement
- Device type identification
- Visual hinge representation

### Simulation Mode

For testing on non-foldable devices:
1. Toggle "Simulation Mode" switch
2. Use the slider to adjust hinge angle (0Â°-180Â°)
3. Try preset positions with quick buttons
4. Observe real-time state changes
